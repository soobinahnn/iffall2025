    <h1>Introductory Q&amp;A</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <span class="question">Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</span>
        My name is Soobin Ahn and I am a Junior majoring in Communication Design, with minors in Human-Computer Interaction and Business of the Arts.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="question">Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</span>
        Most of my design experience has been through Adobe InDesign for Communication Design classes, and I also enjoy painting. I’m taking this class to learn how HTML works and how to design for the web in addition to print.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="question">Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</span>
        I have some experience with HTML/CSS from Typography 1, and I’ve worked with Java in an Intro to Computer Science course. I’ve done small projects with HTML and CSS, and want to get more comfortable with them.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="question">Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</span>
        I hope to learn how to talk about websites and evaluate them in terms of both design and communication, not just appearance.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="question">Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</span>
        Designing for screen is more interactive and flexible. Unlike paper, which is static, screen design must adapt to different devices, sizes, and user interactions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="question">Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</span>
        <a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple</a> — Apple’s website feels intentional: minimal, easy to navigate, and it uses imagery and type to create a clear visual hierarchy.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="question">Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</span>
        <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times</a> — Organizes large amounts of content so it’s easy to scan and read; layout, headlines, and imagery communicate stories effectively.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="question">Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</span>
        <a href="https://palomawool.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paloma Wool</a> — Simple, easy to navigate, and visually consistent with the brand. Product pages balance imagery and text so shopping feels natural and engaging.
