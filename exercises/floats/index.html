  <h1>Floated Elements</h1>

  <p>
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/100" alt="portrait" class="portrait">
    There is an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element at the beginning of this paragraph of text. 
    Because <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tags are inline elements by default, it is making the first line of the paragraph very tall. However, css provides a way to make text flow around the image. We do this with the <strong>float</strong> property.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <span class="blue">float</span> property is applied to the element around which we want text to wrap. It may seem a bit counter-intuitive, but in your HTML code, the floated element must come <em>before</em> the text that wraps around it, just like this document. We can <span class="blue">float: left;</span> or <span class="blue">float: right;</span>, but sadly, we cannot <span class="blue">float: center;</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    We can use <span class="blue">margin</span> on the floated element to control white-space around it, "pushing away" the text that gets too close.
  </p>

  <div class="instructions">
    <ol>
      <li><em>Create a stylesheet and link it to this document.</em></li>
      <li><em>Select the <span class="blue">portrait</span> class, and add the rule <span class="blue">float: left;</span></em></li>
      <li><em>Set a <span class="blue">margin</span> value for the portrait such that it has <strong>2rem</strong> breathing-room to the right and bottom, but <strong>0</strong> top and left.</em></li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <p>
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/100" alt="portrait" class="portrait">
    Let's duplicate the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag above, and place a copy of it at the beginning of this paragraph.
  </p>

  <div class="instructions">
    <ol>
      <li><em>Copy the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag as indicated. No need to style — it will pick up the same styles as the first <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> because it has the same class applied.</em></li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <p>
    See how the Instructions block also floated around the image? Floating an element doesn't only make text wrap… it makes <em>everything</em> that follows the element wrap, until the element is no longer in the way. But what if we don't want that? What if we want to make sure the instructions always 'get past' the floated item, no matter what?
  </p>

  <div class="instructions clear">
    <ol>
      <li><em>Make a selector for <span class="blue">.instructions</span>, and add the rule <span class="blue">clear: both;</span></em></li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <p>
    We use the <span class="blue">clear</span> property to tell a subsequent element to 'clear' floated items. You can <span class="blue">clear: left;</span> to clear any elements that are floated left, <span class="blue">clear: right;</span> to clear any elements that are floated right, or <span class="blue">clear: both;</span> to clear all floated items regardless of the side they're on.
